title: What is Cadence?
---

Cadence is an electronic computer-aided drafting (ECAD) program commonly used in industry for the design and simulation of electronic circuits and printed circuit boards. The following video by Casey Petersen describes the basics of Cadence:

## What are all of the different Cadence file extensions used for?

## What is the Cadence design and manufacturing process?

The Cadence design flow (process) by which a PCB is created with Cadence is described fully in the [Introduction to the PCB Design Flow by Example - Chapter 2 in *Complete PCB Design Using OrCAD Capture and PCB Editor*](http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=249296&site=ehost-live&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_15) book by Kraig Mitzner. It is summarized in 4 steps:

1.  Schematic capture
2.  Design simulation *(optional in the junior project classes)*
3.  Printed circuit board layout
4.  Printed circuit board manufacturing
