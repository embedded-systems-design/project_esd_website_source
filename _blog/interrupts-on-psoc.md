title: Interrupts on PSoC
---

An [interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt) is a signal received by a microcontroller and emitted by hardware or software that is signaling a system event that needs immediate attention. Interrupts are useful to avoid constant monitoring of electronic peripherals (e.g., sensors).

Special care must be taken when using interrupts on the PSoC®. Cypress has published excellent application notes on using interrupts on the PSoC®:

-   [PSoC® 4 Interrupts](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an90799-psoc-4-interrupts) from Cypress
-   [PSoC® 3 and PSoC 5LP Interrupts](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an54460-psoc-3-and-psoc-5lp-interrupts) from Cypress
