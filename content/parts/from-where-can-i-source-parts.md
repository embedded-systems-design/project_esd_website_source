title: From where can I source parts?
---

Once you know the types of components that you need for your project, the next step is to find sources/vendors from which you can purchase the components (also known as *sourcing parts*). Follow the process below to source parts:

1.  Check the [PRLTA 103 Component Catalog spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zs7IGH23BTm1TYUMbUMgAajpoCHKaj_jCZakPANoYIU/edit?usp=sharing) and the parts drawers in PRLTA 103 to see if we have a similar part in stock. Parts in PRLTA 103 do not count toward your prototype budget.

2.  For integrated circuits (ICs), sensors, and actuators, go to the manufacturer's website and see if they offer free samples online. If you can't order them online, call the company's sales line and ask -- companies are often more than happy to give you free parts so that you remember their company after graduation.

3.  Check to see if a compatible part is **in stock** at one of our preferred vendors. Even if you can find parts for a lower cost on other sites, it's better to order from one of our preferred vendors because of our university discount and streamlined ordering process.

ASU Preferred Vendors:

-   Grainger
-   McMaster-Carr
-   MSC Industrial
-   Newark
-   Staples

4.  If the part you need is not available **in stock** from the above sources, you may order from other suppliers. However, the university will not place an order unless the cost of the parts exceeds the cost of shipping, so please try and minimize the number of vendors that you order from to keep our costs down.

Other Vendors to Consider:

-   Adafruit
-   All Electronics
-   Digi-Key
-   Harbor Freight Tools
-   Hobby Engineering
-   Jameco Electronics
-   Microchip
-   Mouser Electronics
-   NewEgg
-   Parallax
-   Robot Mesh
-   RobotShop
-   SparkFun Electronics

5.  Finally, **DO NOT ORDER FROM:**

-   AliExpress
-   AliBaba
-   Rakuten
-   Amazon (without prior written instructor approval)
