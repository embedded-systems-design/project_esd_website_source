## What is a connector?

A connector is an electrical component that links two or more components together. The major types of connectors are:

-   Wire to wire (e.g., an in-line connector that connects a battery to a wire harness)
-   Wire to board (e.g., a connector that attaches a sensor to a printed circuit board)
-   Board to board (e.g., connectors used to mate a daughterboard with a motherboard)
-   Power connectors, which handle higher currents
-   Modular connectors (e.g., Ethernet plugs)
-   Terminal blocks and barrier strips, which are useful for connecting and disconnecting wires with screw terminals (e.g., a connector used inside a sprinkler or security control box)
