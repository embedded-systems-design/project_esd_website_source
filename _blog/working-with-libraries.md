4.  Select the location you would like to save your parts library. This library can be used over and over in multiple projects, so the best place to store it is in one of your top level cadence folders.

5.  Create a new part in the library by right clicking on it and selecting "new part". A dialog will open that will allow you to define a new part and start designing it.
