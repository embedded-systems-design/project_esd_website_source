title: What is a Gantt Chart?
---

A Gantt Chart is a common project management tool that helps teams understand the phases of a project, deadlines, critical paths, and interdependencies between tasks. It is important to gain experience predicting how long tasks take in order to calibrate your time management.

## What software can I use to make a Gantt Chart?

Gantt Charts can be made with a variety of software programs. Here are several free options:

-   [Microsoft Project](http://www.microsoft.com/project/) - Available on [MyApps](https://myapps.asu.edu/) (via Microsoft Imagine). This is the industry-standard project management tool (Windows)
-   [ProjectLibre](https://sourceforge.net/projects/projectlibre/) is an open-source alternative to Microsoft Project (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)
-   [RationalPlan Project Viewer](http://www.rationalplan.com/viewer-project-management-software.php) is a Microsoft Project file viewer (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)
-   Gantt charts can also be made in Microsoft Excel, but will not meet the dependency requirements in Dr. Jordan's assignment requirements.
-   [Gantter](https://gantter.com/) is a cloud-based collaborative Gantt chart tool
-   Microsoft Visio is a general purpose graphical chart generation program with a nice Gantt chart template.  It is available on myapps.asu.edu through Microsoft Imagine
