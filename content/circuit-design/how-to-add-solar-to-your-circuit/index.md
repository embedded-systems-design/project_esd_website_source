Adding solar to a project has a few more steps then just hard wiring a solar panel. Solar panels fluctuate with power delivery to a system. To combat this, solar panels often charge a power cell or battery. This battery provides constant power to your project .

## Needed Components 

-   Solar Panel
-   Lithium Battery
-   Voltage regulator
-   Lithium Ion Battery break out board
-   Filtering capacitors

## Purpose

The lithium ion battery break out board is crucial to preventing any overcharge or over-discharge to your project. The breakout board also limits the solar input to the battery itself and introduces trickle charging to prevent overcharge to your battery. The size of the solar panel and battery needed depends on the power needs of your individual project.
