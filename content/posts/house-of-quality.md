## What is a House of Quality, and what is it used for?

The [House of Quality diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Quality) is used to translate customer requirements, market research, patent benchmarking, and technical benchmarking into product capabilities that can be targeted in a new product design. It is an integral component of the [Quality Function Deployment (QFD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_function_deployment) method for translating qualitative user needs into quantitative requirements.
