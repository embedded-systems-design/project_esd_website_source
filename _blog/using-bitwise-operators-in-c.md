title: Using Bitwise Operators in C
---

## What are bitwise operators?

Bitwise operators allow access to individual bits in a variable or register. A typical register or variable is at least 1 byte (8 bits) in size.

## What bitwise operators are available in C?

&, |, ^, ~, <<, and >>

## Where can I learn more about bitwise operators?

See the [Writing C Code for Microcontrollers with Bitwise Operators](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByRWb7dgVD-rdndyWEk0RlZyLW8/view?usp=sharing) presentation from Dr.Â Jordan.
