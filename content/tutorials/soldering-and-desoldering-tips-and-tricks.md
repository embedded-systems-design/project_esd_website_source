## How do I solder surface mount components using a reflow oven?

This method involves applying solder paste to the pads on the PCB, manually placing your surface mount components into the solder paste, and baking the board in a special oven to solder the entire PCB at once. This method is not really easier than hand soldering for one-off PCBs; you are trading one set of challenges for a different set. If you are interested in using solder paste and the reflow oven to solder your components, please contact [Osama Jameel](mailto:osama.jameel@asu.edu) in PRLTA 109.

## How can I practice soldering without damaging my project?

A great way to practice is to find an old PCB at Goodwill (inside a printer, scanner, camera, floppy drive, etc.) and practice desoldering and soldering components on the board. You can also find old circuit boards in the cabinets in the front of PRLTA 103.
