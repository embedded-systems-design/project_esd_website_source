title: Integrated Development Environments for PSoC
---

In order to program a [Cypress](http://www.cypress.com/) [Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC®)](http://www.cypress.com/products/programmable-system-chip-psoc), you first need to install Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software on your computer. An IDE is program that you install on a computer to support the development of software for a particular hardware platform. It typically includes a text editor for editing source code, a compiler to covert source code into machine code, and a debugger for helping to identify the source of errors in source code.

There are two primary free IDEs available to program on the PSoC® platform. Both will only run on Windows, but will run on a Mac running Windows via [Bootcamp](https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/) or [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/).

1.  [PSoC® Creator](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator)â„¢. This IDE is the simplest to get started with PSoC®.

-   Download it [here](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator) *(requires the creation of a free account).*
-   Training is available [here](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/other-resources/psoc-creator-training).

[PSoC® Designer](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-designer). This IDE allows lower-level configuration of the PSoC® hardware. It is recommended for advanced applications only.
