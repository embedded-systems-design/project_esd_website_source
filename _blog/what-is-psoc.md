---

The [Cypress](http://www.cypress.com/) [Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC®)](http://www.cypress.com/products/programmable-system-chip-psoc) is a mixed-signal electronic hardware platform that integrates a microcontroller core, programmable analog signal processing blocks, programmable digital hardware blocks, and capacitive touch sensing. The following is a list of helpful resources for getting started with the PSoC®:

-   [What is PSoC?](http://www.element14.com/community/message/86810#86810/l/re-100-projects-in-100-days) video from element14
-   [Training on Demand](http://www.cypress.com/training) videos from Cypress
-   [Cypress Developer Community Video Library](https://www.cypress.com/video-library/PSoC) (scroll to the bottom of the page and select the particular PSoC you are using to filter the videos)
-   [PSoC Developer](http://www.psocdeveloper.com/) forums (very useful when trying to solve problems)
