## What is a printed circuit board (PCB)?

See the [What is a Printed Circuit Board?](/what-is-a-printed-circuit-board/) page for more information about PCBs and the general design flow for creating a PCB.

## What is Cadence PCB Editor?

Cadence PCB Editor is an electronic CAD (ECAD) program that takes a netlist created by Cadence Schematic Capture and provides you a software environment to design a PCB. A *[netlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlist)* is a file that describes interconnections among components in a circuit. Read the short [Cadence (Allegro) PCB Designer Datasheet](https://www.cadence.com/content/cadence-www/global/en_US/home/tools/pcb-design-and-analysis/pcb-layout/allegro-pcb-designer.html) for an overview of the software and its features.

## How do I launch Cadence to create a PCB?

In Windows, launch "PCB Editor".

This program is also called "Allegro PCB Designer (was Performance L)" and "Allegro PCB Design L (legacy)". These programs are all equivalent.

## How do I transfer a design from Design Entry CIS to PCB Editor?

See the [Transferring a Cadence Schematic to PCB Editor](/transferring-a-cadence-schematic-to-pcb-editor/) page.

## How do I create a PCB layout in PCB Editor?

1.  [Create a board outline](/creating-a-board-outline-in-cadence-pcb-editor/)
2.  [Change the library search path](/changing-the-default-via-padstack-in-cadence-pcb-editor/) to point to the footprints folder
3.  [Place the components into the design](/placing-and-moving-components-in-cadence-pcb-editor/)
4.  [Route traces on the PCB](/manual-routing-in-cadence-pcb-editor/)
5.  [Follow the ASU PCB Fabrication Process](/asu-pcb-fabrication-process/)

## Misc

Globally changing trace widths: <altering-trace-widths.html>

Globally changing vias: TBD
