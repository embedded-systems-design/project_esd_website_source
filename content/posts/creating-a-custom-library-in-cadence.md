title: Creating a custom library in Cadence
---

In order to use schematic symbols imported from the web or custom created for your project (very common), you must create a custom symbol library in which to save them. It is good practice to create a custom library for each project that you work on to save your schematic symbols. To create a custom library, do the following:

1.  With your project open, choose "File > New > Library". This will create a new library with a default name under Design Resources in the project.

2.  Right-click on the new library and choose "Save As..." You will be prompted to enter a name and choose a location for the custom library. Save the custom library in the same folder as your project files.

3.  Add the custom library to your project by clicking the "Place Part" tool in the toolbar. Then, click the "Add Library" button (which looks like a dotted square with a yellow corner) and locate the library file that you saved in the previous step (it will likely be in a different location than the pre-installed libraries). Click "Open" to add the library to the list of active libraries.

4.  To create a new part in the custom library, right-click on the library and choose "New Part". More information on creating custom parts can be found on the [Creating a Custom Schematic Symbol in Cadence page](creating-a-custom-schematic-symbol-in-cadence.html).
