## What microcontrollers does Atmel specialize in?

Atmel was one of the top IC manufacturers that makes a number of 8-bit, 32-bit, and ARM microcontrollers, including the AVR microcontroller used in the Arduino. Microchip purchased Atmel in 2017 and is maintaining the AVR line of microcontrollers. The following is a list of helpful resources for getting started with Microchip AVR microcontrollers.

## How do I choose an AVR microcontroller?

-   Use the [Microchip Parametric Search Tool](http://www.microchip.com/selection-tools) to find and select AVR microcontrollers.

## What software do I need to install to program an AVR microcontroller?

-   [Atmel Studio](https://www.microchip.com/avr-support/atmel-studio-7) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Microchip

## What hardware do I need to program an AVR microcontroller?

Check the manufacturer's web page for the specific microcontroller you are using for specific information on the hardware you need to program it. Some common programmers include:
